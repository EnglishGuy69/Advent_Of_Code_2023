4:40pm - 4:55pm - part 1
4:55pm - next day - Probably a couple of hours

The trick here was to not do an exhaustive search and realize that each of the paths repeats, but at different
periods. Initially I just multiplied all the periods together, but that is not the lowest common factor of the
numbers. Then I googled LCM and after a couple of tries found the most efficient way to calculate lcm.
